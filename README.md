# flaskintro

Flask is a lightweight microframework. I've been a big fan of flask microframework since 2020. 
This repo is for [farhansaif.xyz](https://farhansaif.xyz) 

The deployed branch contains remote files. Master and deployed repos are same. Other branches contain experimental codes or new features that might be added to the site. 

# To do
1. Add project descriptions.
2. Audio stream api.
3. Online pdf reader for users.

Might add more. Idk.
